# Room temperature

Up to five connected sensors can be specified for the room temperature measurements. If more than one sensor is used, an average value of all sensors is automatically calculated and transmitted to the heating controller.  

To assign the respective sensors to the desired heating circuits, the specific parameter numbers and destinations of the respective sensors must be entered into the variable `rgte_sensorid`. An overview of the connected sensors together with the associated parameter number can be found in the category “One Wire, DHT & MAX! Sensors” (menu item “Heating functions” or by clicking on the menu item “Sensors”).
