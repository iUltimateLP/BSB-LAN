[platformio]
src_dir = . ; BSB_LAN has a rather unusual layout of files in src/, but also in the root dir, so just include all files

; This config is meant to be used with the OLIMEX ESP32-EVB board
[env:esp32-evb]
platform = platformio/espressif32
board = esp32-evb
framework = arduino

; As per https://docs.bsb-lan.de/install.html
upload_speed = 460800 

; BSB-LAN wants to use Arduinos "Minimal SPIFFS partition table, which uses 190 KB of SPIFFS memory"
; However, the min_spiffs.csv table here: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/tools/partitions/min_spiffs.csv
; only has a SPIFFS partition of 0x20000 ~= 130 KB. As of commit 8cf5794, there's a fallback partition config supplied with this repo that we can use.
board_build.partitions = partitions.csv

; As of commit 6e2c492, the project checks for the correct partition scheme. However, since we're using the partition table supplied with this
; project, we'll just define the flag to silence the warning
build_flags =
    -D ARDUINO_PARTITION_min_spiffs

; The standard platform packages of the ESP32 framework are (currently) on Arduino core 2.x.x, whereas the BSB_LAN project
; seems to aim a 3.x.x Arduino core, so manually set the platform package version here to make the code compile
